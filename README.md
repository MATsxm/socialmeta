# Socialmeta plugin for Joomla!
Social-meta is a system plugin for Joomla! which creates open graph and twitter meta tags in the head of the document. The idea is to allow the writer to configure properly the way his article will appear in the social streams.
## Installation
Download the project zip and install it like any other extension. Go to extensions > plugins and find System - Socialmeta, publish it.

> IMPORTANT
>  
> Open and save the configuration of the plugin at least once - even if you didn't provide any data - to set up automatically some default parameters values and be sure to avoid any PHP notices.

## Disclaimer
This plugin has been created for a friend of mine runing a website on Joomla! It was supposed to serve a particular purpose because it was a lack on that particular fields. I decided that it could be useful for anyone using Joomla! and I try now to improve it and make it really generic. So, be confident send me suggestions and we will build together THE solution to fix that matter ONE FOR ALL ;)
## Limitation
Up to now Socialmeta is only compatible with Joomla articles (com_content) and FLEXIcontent items (com_flexicontent). It only implements 2 objects from the open graph protocol: article and video.
## Requirements
Joomla! 3+ (it should also be compatible with 2.5 soon)
