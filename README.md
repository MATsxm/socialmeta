# Socialmeta plugin for Joomla!
Social-meta is a system plugin for Joomla! which creates [open graph](http://og.me) and [twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) meta tags in the head of the document. The idea is to allow the writer to configure properly the way his article will appear in the social streams.
## Installation
Download the project zip and install it like any other extension. Go to extensions > plugins and find System - Socialmeta, publish it.

> IMPORTANT
> Open and save the configuration of the plugin at least once - even if you didn't provide any data - to set up automatically some default parameters values and be sure to avoid any PHP notices.

## Configuration
Go to extensions > plugins and find System - Socialmeta

## Disclaimer
This plugin was created for a friend of mine runing a Joomla! website. It was supposed to serve a particular purpose, because IMHO there was a lack on that particular matter. As it could be useful for anyone using Joomla!, we now **try to improve** it and to make it really **generic**. So, be confident, send me suggestions, and we will build together **the** solution to fix that **ONE FOR ALL** ;)
## Limitation
Up to now Socialmeta is only compatible with Joomla articles (com_content) and FLEXIcontent items (com_flexicontent). It only implements 2 objects from the open graph protocol: article and video.
If you are looking for an open graph solution for implementing the product type to your ecommerce, you should have a look to the [JED](http://extensions.joomla.org)
## Requirements
Joomla! 3+ (it should also be compatible with 2.5 soon)
