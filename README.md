# Socialmeta plugin for Joomla!
Socialmeta is a system plugin for Joomla! which creates open graph and twitter meta tags in the head of the document. The idea is to allow the writer to configure properly the way his article will appear in the social streams.
## Installation
Download the project zip and install it like any other extension. Go to extensions > plugins and find System - Socialmeta, publish it. Open and save the configuration of the plugin at least once even if you don't provide any data to set up automatically some default parameters values and avoid any PHP notices.
